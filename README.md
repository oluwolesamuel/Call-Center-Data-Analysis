# Call-Center-Data-Analysis
A simple project to analyze and visualize a call center's data over the month of October

There is no coding done on this project, the data was recorded in CSV file which was imported into an excel spreadsheet for the analysis and visualisation of the data. The data did not need a lot of cleaning or preprocessing before it was used. Pivot tables were created from the dataset to compare various variables, and slicers were added to each visualization so that results can be filtered and a user can view specific data in more detail.
I have also uploaded the original CSV file to this repository.
Do feel free to reach out if you need any more help with regards to understanding the project or assistance with replication.
